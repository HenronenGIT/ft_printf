## Description

Building legendary `printf` function from the scratch.\
Specifiers included:
| Specifier | Flag |
| --- | ---|
| `c` | |
| `s` | |
| `p` | |
| `d` | |
| `i` | |
| `o` | |
| `u` | |
| `x` | |
| `X` | |
| `f` | |


In this project basic idea is first study and then remake **printf** function found from ANCI C standard library.

## Usage

In the repository you have the `Makefile`, that will handle the compiling of the library for you.

1. When you are at the root of your repository simply run `make`. This will 
compile the library named `libprintf.a`

2.
